Readme: METRICS BEAMER TEMPLATE (April 09) - Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin

This Beamer Template of the Chair of Econometrics was designed for MikTex 2.7 and TexnicCenter as an editor. Both are freeware and have to be installed. You may experience some problems with older versions due to missing packages. 

After installing MikTex 2.7 and TexnicCenter, run the minimal.tex file several times until all missing packages are installed. There should then be 4 warnings which won't hurt you. This template has been extensively debugged for standard use with the programs mentioned above. 

Then: Customize as needed!

Note: If you have technical questions regarding the use of this template, contact me (Andreas Bodmeier). Be sure to have MikTex 2.7 and all necessary packages aswell as TexnicCenter installed.
